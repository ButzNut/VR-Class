# VR-Class

This is the digital artefact I will create during my master's.
While the first few commit messages are not really professional, they are useful to me as I encountered some problems during the initial push.

As the final prototype is still work in progress, the input, systems and features will change a lot during development.

Here is also the link to my website, where I talk a bit more about the prototype: https://blog.jbutz.com/a-virtual-classroom/
